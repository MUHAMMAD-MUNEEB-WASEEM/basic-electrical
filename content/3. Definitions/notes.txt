1) voltage:
Force to move electrical charges(electrons) in a closed path. Its unit is Volt (V)

2) Current:
It is Rate of flow of electrons. Its unit is Ampere (A)

3) Resistance:
It is opposition to flow of current. Its unit is ohms (立)

4) Impedence:
It is collective resistance of whole circuit to alternating current consisting of ohmic resistance(R) and reactance(Xl and Xc), represented by Z. Its unit is ohms (立)

5) Inductive Reactance:
The oppostion to change in current due to presence of inductor, represented by Xl. Its unit is ohms (立)

5) Capacitive Reactance:
The oppostion to change in voltage due to presence of capacitor, represented by Xc. Its unit is ohms (立)

6) Short Circuit:
In short circuit, current is maximum with neglible resistance while the potential difference is 0 


7) Open Circuit:
In open circuit, voltage between two terminals becomes equal to supply(rated) voltage with max resistance while the current flown is 0.
